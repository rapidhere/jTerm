jTerm ver 0.1
=============

Description
-----------

jTerm is a simple jQuery plugin which used to draw a Terminal like block in html.

You can draw as many terminals as you like in different block, or in one block.

You should note that, the terminal jTerm supported is not something like bash or ksh.
jTerm just supports some methods to draw on the 'terminal'.In other words, this is a
curses like plugin, not a commad-line-interface.

Notice
------

This branch is out of maintaince.
RequireJS is not I wanted to use with.
Maybe a need a tool to build a package like jQuery's build util
